## About
The original WinBeta_Video is a very simple Windows 10 app that displays and plays YouTube videos 
from the WinBeta YouTube channel.
WinBeta Video requires the YouTube .NET API, and both MyToolkit and MyToolkit Extended (For playing YouTube Videos).
So, I'll try to fix all "Video not playing" issues.


## Status
- Downshifted from DX11 to DX9 (hellow, my oooldest 14-year Sony Vaio notebook )))
- [Test online video](https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4) seems to be ok!
