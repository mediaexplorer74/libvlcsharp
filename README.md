# LibVLCSharp for UWP (W10M) v1.0.2.0

## About
My fork of famous "VLCSharp" project for my own micro-RnD...

Goal: research W10M 1607 (14393) and W10 "Astoria" (10240) VLC lib compatibility.

## Screenshots

## Status
- VLCLib "downshifted" from DX11 to DX9 (hello, my oooldest 14-year Sony Vaio notebook, how are you? :)))
- [Test online video](https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4) seems to be ok (on PC & WinPhone) !
